# SDG Platform documentation - Developers

This document is intended for developers, to give an overview of what is involved in implementing the SDG reporting platform.

## Technical requirements

This platform is designed to use only open-source software and free services.

[See here](requirements.md) for details on the software, services, and expertise that will be needed for the implementation of this platform.

## Getting started

Implementing this platform involves a few steps:

1. [Forking 2 "starter" repositories](forking.md)
1. [Customising the Jekyll site](customisation.md)
1. [Setting up automated builds](deployment.md)

## Updating the data and metadata

Developers will not typically be involved in maintaining the data and metadata for the platform. However it is important for developers to understand the data management process. [See here](../data-providers/making-updates.md) for instructions on how data providers will be making updates.

## Translating the platform into other languages

Similarly, developers will not usually be involved in translating content. However, it is important for developers to understand how translations are used in the platform. [See here](translation.md) for a technical overview of the multilingual setup in this platform.
